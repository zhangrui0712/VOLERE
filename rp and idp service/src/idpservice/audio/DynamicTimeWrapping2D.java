/**
 * This class used to calculate the distance between two vectors. 
 * these two vectors might have different length, so use dynamic 
 * programming is used to calculate the minimum distance. 
 * 
 * The algorithm can be used for calculating the distance between 
 * two audio files, where each one is represented as MFCCs (2 dimensional features)
 * 
 * There are FIVE things we must specify 
 * 
 * <li> End point constraint </li> 
 * First Point in test pattern meet with first point in reference pattern
 * Last Point in test pattern meet with last point in reference pattern 
 *
 * <li> local continuity constraint </li>
 * Support five different local path  
 * p1 --> (1,0)  
 * p2 --> (2,1)    
 * p3 --> (1,1)
 * p4 --> (1,2)
 * p5 --> (0,1)
 * 
 * <li> Global Path constraint </li>
 * |i(k) - j(k)| <= R   R is constraint value, k is the timing index.
 * 
 * <li> Axis Orientation </li>
 * x-axis refers to the test pattern, y-axis refers to reference/template pattern
 * by default, we use the symmetric case. 
 * 
 * <li> Distance Measure </li>
 * Use Euclidean distance measurement. For the weighting function,
 * choose W(k) = i(k) - i(k-1) + j(k) - j(k-1), which is symmetric function, the advantage
 * of choosing this weighting function is, we don't need to consider the normalization value 
 * for all the summation. Because for all cases, the normalization value will be constant.  
 *  
 * For technical detail, please look at my paper: 
 *      http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3791
